prototype design pattern:(prototype means copy or sample or model)
int notebook most of similar property but some are diff
like funfacts and cover design are unique for every notebook

Need of prototype and regisrty: definitation is given in notes:

problem for V2: 1.private data member(means no getter and setters given)
   
    2.client SRP violated: here what student class should do instead of that
   Client class is doing.
    3. OCP violation: if multiple classes inheriting the same student class then according the condition using if else condition we can creeate the instace of subclass so we have to use more number of if else condition which violates the OCP. if new type of student is added then client will be changed 
coz we need to add more if else so OCP will be violated

copy contructor will not solve the OCP violation


reister: where the samples or the prototypes are stored
