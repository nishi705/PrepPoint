-working with large files
-Nearest neighbour queries(this is a data structure to use to design UBER)
-Quad Trees

HDFS,S3 files how to store them, whats behind the scene. 
so, whenever we have discussing about any system we set the following things
large files,audio,video,test case file these files never stores onto database 
they stores in large file system. Whenevere we have user uploaded content like
imgaes,vedios,i/o files for particular problem test cases all those stores into the large system like S3(simple,store,service)/HDFC(hadoop distributed file system).
Suppose we have to build a large system which can build a very large file.If suppose u have app server where u logging the data but not removing the data in that case.

Whenever we store some kind of lagre file there has to be some constraint/requirnment.

Requirement:
-> storing the extremly large files (100TB)
-> data might be critical so the data should be reliable and durable.
-> Both read and write must be possible
  read: download the files or stream the file on demand of files.
        Another thing is that we should able to do analytics on top of the          files(atleast we should be able to run the complex query)
 
so, if we have large file can we store the file inside the single large server? 
No.

so, how do we store the large filee?
